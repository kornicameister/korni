      Functional world
    </h3>
    <p>
      Since <em><strong>glorious</strong></em> 2018, I have been extending my knowledge regarding 
      <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming" target="_blank">functional programming</a></em>.
    </p>
    <p><i>How did it all start?</i></p>
    <p>
      The story goes back to me joining <em><a href="http://docs.fcsm.io/" target="_blank">EOS</a></em> project. 
      Long story short, but that project was the one that set me on my way functional path. 
      Currently I can tell that I know following languages:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://elm-lang.org" target="_blank">
          <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Elm_logo.svg/512px-Elm_logo.svg.png" title="Elm" alt="Elm logo" />
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.haskell.org/" target="_blank">
          <img src="https://evenmere.org/~bts/haskell-logo/logo-0.svg" title="Haskell" alt="Haskell logo" />
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://fsharp.org/" target="_blank">
          <img src="http://fsharp.org/img/logo/fsharp.svg" title="F#" alt="F#" />
        </a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you are looking for an example, you do not have to look far, <strong>this</strong> page was built with 
      <em>
        <span style="color: red;"><i class="fa-solid fa-heart fa-fw"></i></span>
        <a href="https://astro.build" target="_blank">Astro</a>
      </em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently in a process of learning how to learn others with functional programming. 
      I find this goal very <em>important</em> to pursue. 
      Reason is quite simple! Since early years of studies, my and others heads were filled with imperative programming model. 
      Learning something opposite, at least for me, <strong>rebooting</strong> my mind. 
      Not to mention about boosting up soft skills, especially an ability to share the accumulated knowledge.

      Logging & Monitoring
    </h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://monasca.io" target="_blank"><strong>monasca</strong></a> was my first serious assignment in Fujitsu. 
      We have concentrated on enhancing <em>Openstack</em> monitoring solution with <strong>collecting</strong> and 
      <strong>analyzing</strong> logs. All of the work I have done was done with the little help of 
      <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank" title="Python"><i class="fa-brands fa-python fa-fw"></i></a>. 
      Needless to say that I learnt a lot of that language, going from not knowing a thing about it to mastering its strengths. 
      It is worth mentioning that I was <strong>core</strong> contributor for 
      <a href="http://monasca.io/" target="_blank"><strong>monasca</strong></a> inside of Fujitsu. 
      My contributions can still be examined in following locations:

      Cooking the beans
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>First</strong> real work together with <a href="https://tt.com.pl" target="_blank">Transition Technologies</a>. 
      I think that what best describes this part of my life is being confronted with the real world. 
      No more professors but real deal people to appreciate me or to blame me for not doing something right. 
      I have learnt a great deal about Java and doing things in it. 
      Everything was Java, not only at work but also theses. 
      Spring-* was my best friend for quite some time 🤣.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember that it was especially hard time for me. 
      I have been, simultaneously, studying Logistic and Computer Science. 
      No time to sleep with, exams and theses. But everything worked out somehow.

      Beginning
    </h3>
    <p>
      Beginnings are often hard and it was the case for me as well. 
      Starting out with <em>Pascal</em> was not very good choice. I felt like I cannot do anything. 
      Resurection of, what later has become a <strong>passion</strong> came when I was a student. 
      Who would've thought that starting out with <strong>C++</strong> and <strong>Qt</strong> 
      will lead to exploring depths of objective and functional programming in future.
